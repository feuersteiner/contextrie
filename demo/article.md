# Nexus vs Apex: $47M Cloud Dispute

_Financial Times, Jan 24, 2026_

Nexus Financial is suing cloud provider Apex for $47M after 187 hours of downtime, a ransomware breach disclosed 7 days late, and $1.2M in billing overcharges.

**Key incidents:** Hurricane outage (58hrs), data corruption (2.3M records), ransomware with delayed disclosure, billing fraud, auth failures (94hrs).

**Regulatory fallout:** SEC probe, OCC consent order pending, class action filed.

**Hidden defense:** A source close to Apex claims Nexus disabled monitoring alerts themselves and rejected premium disaster recovery to save $840K/year. Nexus was warned in writing on Aug 3, 2025 about bypassing monitoring hooks.

**Critical footnote:** Amendment 7, signed Sept 1, 2025 (11 days before hurricane), reduced liability cap from "$10M or 24 months fees" to just "12 months fees"—capping Apex's exposure at ~$7.1M, not $47M.
